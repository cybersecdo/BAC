Project Name
Broken Access Control 

Project Description
The script typically works by attempting to access various resources within the application using different user accounts or authentication tokens. It then checks whether the access controls are functioning as expected, and whether the user is able to access resources they should not be able to access.

The script may also attempt to bypass access controls using different techniques, such as modifying session tokens or cookies, manipulating URLs, or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application. By doing so, it can identify weaknesses in the access control mechanism that could be exploited by attackers.

The script may generate a report detailing any vulnerabilities that were found, including the specific resources that were accessed, the user accounts used to access them, and any issues with the access control mechanisms that were identified. This report can then be used to inform further security testing and remediation efforts.
